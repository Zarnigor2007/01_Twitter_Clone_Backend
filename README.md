# Twitter Clone - Dev Project

**This project is my first-ever backend project :D**
So, instead of focusing on frontend of the site, I mostly focused on the backend. Yes, there are still some flaws, but I think it's nice to have some errors in the first project, right???

**Essential credits for frontend:**
  - Profile Page: https://codepen.io/Danielb44/pen/MWaPLBK
  - Main Page: https://codepen.io/mithicher/pen/JjdgYdy
  - Log In & Register pages: https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/forms/sign-in-forms
    *and some tailoring for sweeter experience!*


#Technologies used in this project:
 - HTML, CSS
 - JavaScript(most of which is not working)
 - Tailwind.CSS
 - Python Django framework for backend.

*Note: This project may or may not be updated in the future.*
